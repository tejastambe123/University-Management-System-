The main tasks performed in this project include:
- Implementing a **secure login system** for administrators
- Managing **student information** (add, view, update)
- Managing **teacher information**
- Displaying academic and administrative data using database connectivity
- Connecting Java application with MySQL database using **JDBC**
- Handling database operations such as insert, update, delete, and retrieve records

The project follows a modular approach where database connectivity, UI design, and business logic are handled separately.
